This **Bash** script allows you to retrieve information about phone numbers using Google's **libphonenumber** library. It provides details such as location, carrier, country code, and time zone.

---

## 📜 Description

The script analyzes a given phone number and returns relevant information, including:

- 📞 **National Format**
- 🌍 **Country Code**
- 📍 **Estimated Location**
- 🛜 **Carrier/ISP**
- ⏰ **Time Zone**
- ⌛ **And More...**

It uses **phonenumbers**, a Python library, to process the number and extract the information.

---

## 📋 Requirements

Before running the script, ensure you meet the following requirements:

- A **Linux/Unix** system with **Bash**.
- Python 3 installed.
- The `phonenumbers` library installed.

You can install the library with:

```bash
pip install phonenumbers
```

You also need to grant execution permissions to the script:
```bash
sudo chmod +x phonelyzer.sh
```

---

## 🚀 Usage

To run the script, simply provide the phone number as an argument:

### 📌 Syntax:
```bash
./phonelyzer.sh +<Prefix_Country><phone_number>
```

### 📌 Example:
```bash
./phonelyzer.sh +34666777888
```

If the number is valid, the script will return information like this:

```bash

🔍 === NUMBER INFORMATION ===
📞 National format: 666 77 78 88
🌐 International format: +34 666 77 78 88
⚡ E.164 format: +34666777888
🌍 Country: Spain (+34, ES)
🛜 Carrier/ISP: Vodafone
⏰ Time zone(s): Atlantic/Canary, Europe/Madrid
📱 Number type: 📱 Mobile
✅ Valid: Yes (A valid number can be dialed and is assigned to a real telephone)
🔍 Possible: Yes (A possible number matches the length and digit pattern of numbers in that region)

```

---

## 🛠 Configuration and Customization

If you want to modify the script, you can edit the Python block inside `phonelyzer.sh`. 
For example, to change the language of geolocation output, modify this line:

```python
location = geocoder.description_for_number(phone_number, 'en')  # Change 'en' to 'es' for Spanish
```

You can also adjust the output format by editing the `print()` statements in the script.

---

## ⚠️ Notes and Warnings

- 📌 The script works best with properly formatted numbers, including the country code (e.g., `+34` for Spain).
- 🚨 The accuracy of the information is not guaranteed, as it relies on the `libphonenumber` database.
- ❌ It does not provide private or personal data, only public information based on the number prefix.
